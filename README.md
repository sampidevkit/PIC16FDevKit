![](https://github.com/sampidevkit/PIC16FDevKit/blob/master/HW/Product/Picture/PIC16DevKit%20v1.0%20Top%20(1).png?raw=true)
This is an open source project, a development kit of PIC16F877A and PIC16F18877.<br/>
<br/>[PIC16F877A:](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F877A)<br/>
This powerful (200 nanosecond instruction execution) yet easy-to-program (only 35 single word instructions) CMOS FLASH-based 8-bit microcontroller packs Microchip's powerful PIC® architecture into an 40- or 44-pin package and is upwards compatible with the PIC16C5X, PIC12CXXX and PIC16C7X devices. 
The PIC16F877A features 256 bytes of EEPROM data memory, self programming, an ICD, 2 Comparators, 8 channels of 10-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter, 2 capture/compare/PWM functions, the synchronous serial port can be configured as either 3-wire Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI™) or the 2-wire Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C™) bus and a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART). 
All of these features make it ideal for more advanced level A/D applications in automotive, industrial, appliances and consumer applications.<br/>
<br/>[PIC16F18877:](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18877)<br/>
PIC16(L)F1885X/7X microcontrollers feature Analog, Core Independent Peripherals and communication peripherals, combined with eXtreme Low Power (XLP) for a wide range of general purpose and low-power applications. 
The family features the CRC/SCAN, HLT and Windowed WDT to support customers looking to add safety to their application. 
Additionally, this family includes up to 56 KB of Flash memory, along with a 10-bit ADC with Computation (ADC2) for automated signal analysis to reduce the complexity of the application.<br/>
