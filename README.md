# Target MCU [PIC16F18877:](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18877)<br/>
PIC16(L)F1885X/7X microcontrollers feature Analog, Core Independent Peripherals and communication peripherals, combined with eXtreme Low Power (XLP) for a wide range of general purpose and low-power applications. 
The family features the CRC/SCAN, HLT and Windowed WDT to support customers looking to add safety to their application. 
Additionally, this family includes up to 56 KB of Flash memory, along with a 10-bit ADC with Computation (ADC2) for automated signal analysis to reduce the complexity of the application.<br/>
