  @Summary:
    This is the generated driver implementation file for handling traps
    using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs traps.
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC32MM0064GPM028
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.61
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.45
